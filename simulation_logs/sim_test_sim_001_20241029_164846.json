      "facilitator_notes": "I'll help evaluate this trade offer between Alice and Bob.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Alice is offering 2 books in exchange for 1 cooking skill lesson from Bob\n2. Resource check:\n   - Alice has 3 books, so she can afford to give 2\n   - Bob has 2 cooking skills, so he can provide 1\n3. Both parties have sufficient resources\n4. No concerning patterns in trading history (empty history)\n5. The trade seems fair and balanced:\n   - Books provide knowledge value\n   - Cooking skills provide practical value\n   - The 2:1 ratio seems reasonable given the effort required for cooking instruction\n\nRecommendation: This appears to be a fair and feasible trade. Both parties have the necessary resources, and the exchange rate is reasonable. The trade would benefit both parties - Alice gains valuable cooking skills while Bob receives educational materials. I recommend accepting the trade.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific aspect of this analysis in more detail?",
