System Name: CommonPool Exchange Simulation

Core Purpose:
A simulation environment where participants with distinct personalities engage in bilateral bartering, supported by a human facilitator who can suggest (but not enforce) valuations.

Key Components:

1. Participant System
- Attributes:
  * ID/Name
  * Personality Type (e.g., "cautious", "generous", "value-maximizing")
  * Resources (things, skills, time)
  * Needs/Wants
  * Exchange history
  * Notes/Context

2. Exchange Mechanism
- Pure bilateral bartering
- No enforced valuation rules
- Records of:
  * Successful exchanges
  * Failed negotiations
  * Facilitator suggestions
  * Negotiation notes

3. Facilitator Role
- Record keeping
- Suggestion making
- Context providing
- Historical reference
- No direct intervention in exchanges

4. Simple State Storage
- Participant states
- Exchange history
- System context
- Facilitator notes

Sample Usage:
```python
# Initialize with personality types
sim = ExchangeSimulation(
    participants=[
        ("Alice", "generous", {"books": 3, "gardening_hours": 5}),
        ("Bob", "cautious", {"cooking_skills": 2, "tools": 4})
    ]
)

# Record an exchange attempt
sim.record_exchange_attempt(
    participant1="Alice",
    participant2="Bob",
    proposed_exchange={
        "alice_offers": ["2 books"],
        "bob_offers": ["1 cooking_lesson"]
    },
    facilitator_notes="Suggested equal value. Bob hesitant.",
    outcome="failed"
)
```

The system is essentially a structured record-keeper of:
1. Who has what
2. Who wants what
3. Exchange attempts
4. Facilitator suggestions
5. Outcomes


Here's a non-technical explanation of the CommonPool Exchange Simulation:

**What Is It?**
Imagine a community marketplace where people can trade directly with each other - but instead of using money, they exchange goods, skills, and time. Our system creates a supportive environment for these exchanges, where each person has their own digital helper that reflects their trading style and personality.

**Key Players**
1. **Participants** - Community members who want to trade. Each has their own AI assistant that:
   - Knows what resources they have to offer
   - Understands what they need
   - Reflects their personal trading style (e.g., cautious, generous, practical)
   - Remembers past exchanges

2. **The Facilitator** - A friendly guide (also AI-powered) who:
   - Suggests fair values for trades
   - Provides helpful context from past exchanges
   - Takes notes to help future trades
   - Never forces decisions, only advises

**How It Works**
1. **Starting a Trade**
   - Alice wants to learn cooking and has books to trade
   - Her AI helper knows her style and what she has to offer
   - She makes an offer to Bob, who teaches cooking

2. **The Negotiation**
   - The facilitator looks at the proposed trade and suggests if it seems fair
   - Bob's AI helper considers the offer based on his personality and needs
   - They can discuss back and forth until they agree or decide to pass

3. **Recording & Learning**
   - Whether successful or not, every exchange attempt is remembered
   - This helps make future trades smoother
   - Everyone can learn what works and what doesn't

**Example Scenario:**
> Alice: "I'd like to learn cooking and can offer some books in exchange."
> 
> Facilitator: "Based on previous exchanges, 2-3 books for a cooking lesson has been typical."
> 
> Bob (who's cautious): "I appreciate the offer. Could we start with one lesson for two books and see how it goes?"
> 
> Alice (who's generous): "That sounds perfect! When shall we start?"

**What Makes It Special?**
- Personal AI helpers mean everyone's trading style is respected
- The facilitator provides guidance without controlling
- Everything is remembered to help future exchanges
- It's all conversation-based - no complicated rules or systems to learn

**Questions We'd Love Your Feedback On:**
1. How comfortable would you feel having an AI helper represent your trading style?
2. What personality types should we include beyond "cautious" and "generous"?
3. What kind of facilitator suggestions would be most helpful to you?
4. How much back-and-forth negotiation feels right to you?
5. What information would you want to know about past trades?

Your thoughts will help us make this system more useful and comfortable for everyone in the community.
